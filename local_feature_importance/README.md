# LMDI+ Experiments


## Sections 4: Synthetic Ranking

To reproduce the results in section 4.1 of the LMDI+ paper:
- Run `imodels-experiments/feature_importance/00_ranking_submit_all.sh`. This script runs synthetic ranking experiments for all datasets.
- Visualize the results using the notebook `imodels-experiments/feature_importance/results_visulization_ranking.ipynb`.

## Section 4: Correlation Bias Results

See the `README.md` in the `imodels-experiments/feature_importance/correlation-bias/` folder for instructions to reproduce correlation bias analyses.

## Sections 4: Real-Data Feature Selection

To reproduce the results in section 4.3 of the LMDI+ paper:
- Run `imodels-experiments/feature_importance/01_selection_submit_all.sh`. This script runs stability experiments for all datasets.
- Visualize the results using the notebook `imodels-experiments/feature_importance/01_results_visulization_selection.ipynb`.

## Section 5: Stability Experiments

To reproduce the results in Section 5 of the LMDI+ paper:
- Run `imodels-experiments/feature_importance/02_stability_submit_all.sh`. This script runs stability experiments for all datasets.
- Visualize the results using the notebook `imodels-experiments/feature_importance/02_results_visulization_stability.ipynb`.

## Section 7: Counterfactual Results

See the `README.md` in the `imodels-experiments/feature_importance/counterfactuals/` folder for instructions to reproduce counterfactual analyses.

## Section 8: Subgroup Results

See the `README.md` in the `imodels-experiments/feature_importance/subgroup/` folder for instructions to reproduce subgroup analyses.
